# Build-a-Smart-Cane-for-the-Visually-Impaired

In this workshop, we’ll show you one of the many ways DIY tech can be used to improve the everyday lives of people of determination. With a little bit of Arduino magic, we’ll demonstrate how you can modify a cane typically used by a visually impaired person, to give it the ability to sense out obstacles in the way (with the help of ultrasonics) and present audio cues to the user accordingly.  

Hardware required: —Arduino Uno —HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors —Jumper Wires —DC Buzzer
